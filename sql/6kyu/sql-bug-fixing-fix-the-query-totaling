❓ DESCRIPTION
Timmy works for a statistical analysis company and has been given a task of totaling the number of sales
on a given day grouped by each department name and then each day.

Resultant table:
day (type: date) {group by} [order by asc]
department (type: text) {group by} [In a real world situation it is bad practice to name a column after a table]
sale_count (type: int)

✅ SOLUTION
SELECT
  s.transaction_date::date as day,
  d.name as department,
  COUNT(s.id) as sale_count
  FROM sale s
    JOIN department d on s.department_id = d.id
  group by day, d.name
  order by day asc
